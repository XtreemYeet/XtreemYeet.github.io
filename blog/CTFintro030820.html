            <h3>Making a Capture the flag is a great learning experience...</h3>
            Especially when you realise that you could have done things 10x better the day after you submit it.

Sometimes, the best way to learn something is to teach it. With ready-to-roll platforms freely available all you need is a little bit of creativity and a hypervisor to deliver simple tasks that teach both yourself and others a whole range of technical skills, from managing computer networks to recovering lost files you accidentally deleted "forever".

Usually, most people spin a copy of CTFd, <a href="https://ctfd.io/">an excellent platform you can read more about here</a> however we're going to use something different:

<a href="https://ctfd.io/">FacebookCTF</a>, an alternate platform that has a beautiful interface that's easy to understand and easy on the eyes.

            <span class="article">FacebookCTF has a world map interface where each highlighted country represents a challenge, this lets us visually group challenges together by difficulty, type, or following a logical process.

Clicking on a country opens up a box with all the information you need to start the challenge and submit results. It supports file uploads too, if you have any challenges that you don't need a virtual machine / container to run.

In an easy two-part challenge called "Hack the Planet", the user starts off with the basics, where to go (192.168.10.14) and what to use (FTP). From this, anyone can figure out how to access the service and get their first flag. The second challenge in the series relies on having picked up information from the first, so users can't skip over the basics when learning.
